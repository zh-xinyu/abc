Code for the ABC project.

> Note: we have released a minimal training pipeline for ABC-DiT & conversion scripts for the data. We also re-host a small subset of the sim data and real data for 1 task to allow users to get started. Please check back later for the full code release, including VLA training, real deployment infra & pretrained checkpoints.


## Release Roadmap
- [x] June 17 -- Release Minimal Training Pipeline
- [ ] End of June -- Release all sim data 
- [ ] By end of July -- full code release

## Setup

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# Install ffmpeg.
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg     # on Linux
```

```bash
# Pin Python and create the project venv. uv reads pyproject.toml here.
cd abc
uv python pin 3.12
uv sync
```

## Training

First we need to download the requisite data (norm stats and either a sample or full data.)
```bash
uv run prepare.py            # preview (a few episodes of data, ~130MB)
uv run prepare.py --full     # all data for bottles in bin (~35GB)
uv run prepare.py --checkpoint  # add to also pull the pretrained 75k policy (~7.7GB)
```

This populates the cache dir (default `cache/`, or `ABC_CACHE` if set) with:

```
cache/
  norm_stats.json                       # state/action z-score stats
  train_real/episode_<uuid>/{states_actions.bin, combined_camera-images-rgb.mp4, episode_metadata.json}
  val_real/...
  train_sim/...
  val_sim/...
```

Set `ABC_CACHE=/path/to/cache` before running commands if you want the cache
outside the repository.

:warning: Note: `prepare.py` does not download DINO weights. Review and follow the DINO license terms, then download the weights from [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/dinov3-downloads/) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m). Save the file as `dinov3_vitb16_pretrain_lvd1689m.pth` in the cache dir. :warning:

The command to run training is below. Note that this is for single node training with 8 GPUs, change `nproc-per-node` if you want.

```bash
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py
```
The dataclass config is exposed as CLI flags; `uv run python train.py --help`
shows training, optimizer, flow, CLIP asset, and model options such as
`--model.hidden-size`, `--model.depth`, and `--model.camera-keys`. The default
model config is the checkpoint-compatible ABC-DiT XL shape.

If you pulled with `--full` above, this checkpoint is expected to work for
the bottles in bin task in both sim and real. The performance should be similar
to [this](assets/bottles_real.mp4).

Training defaults in `abc_minimal/config.py` match the production reference
finetune (lr 1e-4 with a 1k-step linear warmup, AdamW(0.9, 0.95), wd 0.01,
grad clip 10, prefix conditioning max 4 with noise 0.05, 10% state masking,
batch 90/GPU, 75k steps, hours-weighted 2-component mixture).
The dataclass config is exposed as CLI flags; `uv run python train.py --help`
shows training, optimizer, flow, CLIP asset, and model options such as
`--model.hidden-size`, `--model.depth`, and `--model.camera-keys`. The default
model config is the checkpoint-compatible ABC-DiT XL shape. If you have fewer GPUs
than 8 you may need to reduce nproc per node or if you have less than 80Gb of
VRAM you may need to reduce `--batch-size`.

The above training yields ~2.6-3 iterations / sec on H100/H200. It achieves a training
loss of ~`0.048` after 75k steps.

## Evaluation

You can either evaluate a checkpoint you trained yourself (drops into
`cache/finetune_checkpoints/last.pt`) or download our public
pretrained 75k-step bottles policy:

```bash
# Pulls cache/bottles_75k.pt (~7.7 GB) from the public bucket,
# alongside norm_stats.json and the preview tar.
uv run prepare.py --checkpoint
```

To visualize the policy live:

```bash
uv run viz_policy.py --sim.checkpoint cache/bottles_75k.pt --port 8080
```

opens a viser window at `localhost:8080`. It should look like this:

![](assets/sim_eval.gif)

`eval_policy.py` runs a more systematic evaluation:

```bash
# 20 worlds, save a video of each rollout, log per-chunk progress.
uv run eval_policy.py \
    --checkpoint cache/bottles_75k.pt \
    --num-worlds 20 \
    --save-video --log-every-chunk

# Output: $REPO/outputs/sim_eval_put_bottles/
#   summary.json     — success_rate, num_success, mean_max_bottles_in_bin
#   world_*.mp4      — per-world rollout videos (with --save-video)
```

Useful flags:

- `--num-worlds N` — independent random scenes (default 5).
- `--num-chunks N` — action chunks per rollout; each chunk is
`--execute-chunk-dim` actions (defaults: 120 chunks × 15 = 1800 sim steps).
- `--diffusion-steps N` — flow-matching Euler steps per inference
(default 10, matches production).
- `--checkpoint` — accepts a local `.pt` path or `s3://…/<file>.pt`.
- `--norm-stats-path` — explicit `norm_stats.json` (otherwise uses the
one bundled in the checkpoint).
- `--fast-inference` / `--no-fast-inference` (default on) — bf16 +
torch.compile + CUDA-graph captured `sample_actions`. ~5× faster
inference; first call pays a one-time ~25 s compile cost.
- `--vanilla-physics` / `--no-vanilla-physics` (default off) — enable
vanilla CPU `mujoco.mj_step` for env physics instead of the default
single-world mjwarp path.  This is because for single environments, it's
faster to use vanilla mujoco. Rendering still happens in MJWarp.

Note that the first launch compiles MJWarp's CUDA kernels (~1 min).

## Episode exports & training data format

While we host a single task in training format, there are many more in the ABC Dataset.
The ABC-130k MCAPs are hosted on Hugging Face at
[`XDOF/ABC-130k`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XDOF/ABC-130k). The dataset
is gated, so accept access on the dataset page and set `HF_TOKEN` before
downloading.

Download all MCAPs for one task and convert them in place:

```bash
uv run export_hf_task.py --task organize_the_condiment_bottles
```

By default this downloads both `train` and `val`, stages raw MCAPs under
`$ABC_CACHE/hf_tasks/<task>/`, runs `export_mcap.py`, writes converted episodes
to `$ABC_CACHE/train_real/` and `$ABC_CACHE/val_real/`, then deletes the staged
raw MCAPs after each successful split conversion. For a quick smoke test:

```bash
uv run export_hf_task.py --task organize_the_condiment_bottles --split train --max-episodes 1
```

If you already have local MCAPs, call the lower-level converter directly:

```bash
uv run export_mcap.py ./train_run_1 ./out
```

The input is expected to look like:

```text
train_run_1/
  <task_name>/
    episode_<uuid>/
      episode.mcap
```

You can also pass the number of worker processes:

```bash
uv run export_mcap.py ./train_run_1 ./out 8
```

Each output episode is written to `./out/episode_<uuid>/` in the same format
the trainer reads:

```text
episode_<uuid>/
  states_actions.bin               # (num_steps, 28) float64: 14 states + 14 actions
  combined_camera-images-rgb.mp4   # 30 fps vertical stack of 224x224 camera views
  episode_metadata.json            # task name, cameras, resolutions, timing, num_steps
```

The mp4 is encoded in a manner that allows for efficient dataloading. For details, see the ABC paper.

## Our Modifications

> The following features are **not** part of the upstream ABC release. They were
> added by our team to support local experiments.

### Gradient Accumulation

The training loop now supports gradient accumulation via `--grad-accum-steps N`.
The effective batch size becomes `batch_size × nproc × grad_accum_steps`.

```bash
# Example: 8 GPUs × batch 30 × 3 accum steps = effective batch 720
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py \
  --grad-accum-steps 3
```

A reference launch script is provided at `shs/train.sh`:

```bash
WANDB_NAME=<your_run_name> \
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True \
ABC_CACHE=/path/to/cache \
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py \
  --log-wandb \
  --wandb-project abc_minimal \
  --mixture-preset bottles \
  --grad-accum-steps 3 \
  --output-dir outputs/checkpoints/<your_output_dir> \
  2>&1 | tee train.log
```

### LeRobot Policy Evaluation

`eval_lerobot.py` evaluates a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)
policy checkpoint (ACT, Diffusion, etc.) in the ABC MuJoCo-Warp put-bottles sim.
It reuses the same sim environment, rollout logic, and image preprocessing as
`eval_policy.py`.

```bash
uv run eval_lerobot.py \
    --checkpoint <path/to/lerobot/checkpoint> \
    --num-worlds 20 \
    --save-video --log-every-chunk
```

The `--checkpoint` path should point to a lerobot checkpoint directory containing
`pretrained_model/` (or the `pretrained_model/` dir itself). Output goes to
`outputs/sim_eval_lerobot/` by default (override with `--output-dir`).

LeRobot is installed as an editable submodule from `third_party/lerobot`. After
cloning, initialize it with:

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/lerobot
uv sync
```
